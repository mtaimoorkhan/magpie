The complete setup of the application is divided in to 3 steps.
Step 1: a. Get ready with enviornment.
        b. Run the requirement.txt on the server.
        c. Check all the installation packages.

Step 2: a. Run the Data source pre processor file from the code folder.
        b. Run the model training file but note the accuracy of the epocs and also check for the val_acc= 60% and above. at the end.
        c. To save all the model just do best model = false in the model train code.
        
Step 3: a. Run the predict.py
        b. The r prdeict.py hold the locations of the model edit as per your local or server address.
        c. run the model by passing the data source of your choice also provide the data source location in the predict.py.
        

I hope the setup and installation of libraries is quite simple and easier as time goes we will improve and try to make shell script for all this three steps.
